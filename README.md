# Customer_Spending_Analysis
## Overview:
### For this project the goal was to create an analysis using customer spending data. Additionally, I wanted to try and create a machine learning mmodel to try and correctly predict the customer spending score (if the spending score was over or under 75 which was the 75th percentile). This data was a smaller data set just under 2000 data points. I did have to make some adjustments to the data and drop any null value and make sure there weren;t any duplicates. I alos had an issue with the age column because the ages did not make sense. For example, the age of one customer would be listed as two years old but the profession would be a doctor. So I thought the easiest thing would be do drop the age column so it would not skew the data. I also got rid of the customer id column. The left over columns were the profession, work experience, annual income, gender, family size, and spending score.
